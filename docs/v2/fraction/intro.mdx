## What is Fraction?

Fraction is a Solana program that automatically splits all incoming SPL tokens (e.g., USDC, SOL, or any SPL token) among recipients according to pre-configured percentage shares. Built for autonomous agents and applications, Fraction enables seamless revenue distribution without manual intervention.

## How It Works

### 1. Create Configuration
You create a `fraction_config` that defines:
- **Recipients**: Who receives funds and their percentage shares
- **Authority**: Who can update the configuration
- **Agent**: Automated bot that triggers distributions

### 2. Receive Funds
Anyone can send tokens directly to your fraction configuration address. All tokens accumulate in a treasury account until distribution.

### 3. Automatic Distribution
An authorized agent (cranker) monitors the treasury and initiates `claim` transactions that:
- Distribute all accumulated funds according to configured percentages
- Transfer the agent's 0.05% protocol fee
- Complete all transfers atomically in a single transaction
- Empty the treasury completely

## Key Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Atomic Distribution" icon="atom">
    All transfers happen in a single transaction, ensuring consistency and preventing partial distributions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Zero Manual Steps" icon="robot">
    Once configured, distributions happen automatically when triggered by authorized agents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Token Support" icon="coins">
    Works with any SPL token - USDC, SOL, project tokens, or custom mints.

## Distribution Mechanics

When an authorized agent executes distribution:

1. **Protocol Fee**: Agent receives 0.05% as incentive
2. **Participant Split**: Remaining funds distributed per configured percentages
3. **Atomic Execution**: All transfers occur in single transaction
4. **Complete Drainage**: Treasury is emptied entirely
5. **No Manual Steps**: Recipients automatically receive their shares
